        <p>My favourite hobby is doing coding in my free time because I like to make apps and websites. I learned coding from whitehatjr. and now i can code very well and make games and apps. I practice coding everday after school.I've been interested in technology (mainly computers and other electronics) and programming for quite a while now. And although I enjoy programming as a hobby very much, I have some doubts of going into programming / software development as a career. Instead I'm aiming towards other computer careers like consulting or computer security. </p>

        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I have always been passionate about programming. It all started when I first played video games as a kid. I vividly remember how much fun I had playing Snail Mail, Tropix, Feeding Frenzy, Cars, and Hamsterball on my Dad's laptop before. I especially had fun with the Cars game, having spent hours of just roaming (or rather racing) around the open world.

            My passion for gaming grew when my Dad bought a PS2. The games I played the most were Scooby-Doo! First Frights, Spongebob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, G-Force, Crash: Mind over Mutant, and Need for Speed: Underground 2 (Shout out to all the Riders on the Storm!).

            Years later, my Dad bought another gaming console; this time, it was the Xbox 360. I played a lot of NBA 2K, Assassin's Creed, Far Cry 4, Just Cause 2, GTA V, and Skyrim. Later on, I briefly went back to PC gaming. I would add Minecraft as an honorable mention in that regard.I have always wondered how people managed to create such vast worlds inside a TV/computer screen; how they were able to make something out of nothing; how they were able to tell a computer what to do. All of these video games made me want to follow the footsteps of the game developers. I, too, wanted to create something that would have a lasting impact on people; something that would trigger nostalgia; something that would serve as a temporary relief for people going through tough times; something that is worthwhile; something that makes people happy; something that would make me happy. Combined with my passion for learning and Mathematics, the stage was set for me to begin my programming journey.

            In order to make sure that I understood the basics of programming, I started with web development to keep things simple. I could say that I did not regret that decision at all. Perhaps I could even say that it was the best decision I could have made at the time. In many ways, JavaScript helped me understand what programming truly is and how it works (which I can say right now is more than just typing fast and memorizing syntax). Now that I'm learning C++ to start my journey in game development, all of my knowledge in JavaScript (and TypeScript as an honorable mention) is making the learning process easier, faster, and more intuitive.

            Anyway, it's important to know why we code in the first place to prevent the dreaded burnout. Forgetting our roots will surely get us lost in the monotony of programming. With that said, who or what was your inspiration to do programming? For sure, mine were video games and the passion for learning, Mathematics, and creating things (that work, function, and serve purpose to others).</p>
